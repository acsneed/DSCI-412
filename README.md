# DSCI-412

This class has taught me a lot about predictive modeling and using the coding language R. Each week taught new methods of analyzing data as well as ways to make predictions from a dataset.

In week 1, the two main things I learned was the bias-variance tradeoff and the basics of evaluating linear regression models.

In week 2, the two main things I learned was how to explore data using summary statistics and what to do when missing values in a dataset.

In week 3, the two main things I learned was how to create/analyze linear regression models and how to determine the models prediction accuracy.

In week 4, the two main things I learned was how to create/analyze a logistic regression model and how to measure the performance of a classifier.

In week 5, the two main things I learned was how to use GLM and how to create/analyze gamma regression models.

In week 6, the two main things I learned was how to create/analyse decision trees models and how to create/analyze random forest models.

In week 7, the two main things I learned was how to use kmeans clustering and applications of unsupervised learning.

In week 8, the two main things I learned was how to prepare a presentation and how to use github.
